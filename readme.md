+
+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]
+jobs:
+Explore-GitHub-Actions:
+runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+steps:
+
+run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
+run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
+run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
+name: Check out repository code
+uses: actions/checkout@v3
+run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
+run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
+name: List files in the repository
+run: |
+ls ${{ github.workspace }}
+run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
+Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
+Commit workflow file
+Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
+
+Viewing your workflow results
+On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
+
+Under your repository name, click Actions.
+Actions tab in the main repository navigation
+
+In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
+
+Workflow list in left sidebar
+
+From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
+
+Name of workflow run
+
+Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
+
+Locate job
+
+The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
+
+Example workflow results
+
+For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
+Example action detail
+
+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
+
+Next steps
+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+
+Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
+You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
+GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

+
+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
Explore-GitHub-Actions:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
name: Check out repository code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
name: List files in the repository
run: |
ls ${{ github.workspace }}
run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
Commit workflow file
Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions.
Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
Example action detail

More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
Explore-GitHub-Actions:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
name: Check out repository code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
name: List files in the repository
run: |

GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]

+
+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]
+jobs:
+Explore-GitHub-Actions:
+runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+steps:
+
+run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
+run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
+run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
+name: Check out repository code
+uses: actions/checkout@v3
+run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
+run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
+name: List files in the repository
+run: |
+ls ${{ github.workspace }}
+run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
+Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
+Commit workflow file
+Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
+
+Viewing your workflow results
+On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
+
+Under your repository name, click Actions.
+Actions tab in the main repository navigation
+
+In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
+
+Workflow list in left sidebar
+
+From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
+
+Name of workflow run
+
+Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
+
+Locate job
+
+The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
+
+Example workflow results
+
+For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
+Example action detail
+
+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
+
+Next steps
+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+

+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]

+Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
+Commit workflow file
+Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
+
+Viewing your workflow results
+On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
+
+Under your repository name, click Actions.
+Actions tab in the main repository navigation
+
+In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
+

+
+From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

+
+The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
+
+Example workflow results
+
+For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
+Example action detail
+
+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
+
+Next steps
+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+
+Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.

+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]

+- run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
+- name: List files in the repository
+run: |
+ls ${{ github.workspace }}

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
Explore-GitHub-Actions:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
name: Check out repository code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
name: List files in the repository
run: |
ls ${{ github.workspace }}
run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
Commit workflow file
Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions.
Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
Example action detail

More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
Explore-GitHub-Actions:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."

name: List files in the repository
run: |
ls ${{ github.workspace }}
run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
Commit workflow file
Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Commit workflow file

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions.
Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
Example action detail

More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

+
+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]
+jobs:
+Explore-GitHub-Actions:
+runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+steps:
+
+run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
+run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
+run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
+name: Check out repository code
+uses: actions/checkout@v3
+run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
+run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
+name: List files in the repository
+run: |
+ls ${{ github.workspace }}
+run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
+Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
+Commit workflow file
+Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
+
+Viewing your workflow results
+On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
+
+Under your repository name, click Actions.
+Actions tab in the main repository navigation
+
+In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
+
+Workflow list in left sidebar
+
+From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
+
+Name of workflow run
+
+Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
+
+Locate job
+
+The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
+
+Example workflow results
+
+For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
+Example action detail
+
+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
+
+Next steps
+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+
+Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
+You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
+GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+
+Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
+You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
Explore-GitHub-Actions:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
name: Check out repository code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
name: List files in the repository
run: |
ls ${{ github.workspace }}
run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
Commit workflow file
Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions.
Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
Example action detail

More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
Example action detail

More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
Explore-GitHub-Actions:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:

run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
name: Check out repository code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
name: List files in the repository
run: |
ls ${{ github.workspace }}
run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.

Introduction
You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.

The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.

Creating your first workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.

In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."

Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:

YAML
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]

steps:
- run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
- run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
- run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
- name: Check out repository code
uses: actions/checkout@v3
- run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
- run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
- name: List files in the repository
run: |
ls ${{ github.workspace }}
- run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
Commit workflow file

Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.

Viewing your workflow results
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.

Under your repository name, click Actions.
Actions tab in the main repository navigation

In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

Workflow list in left sidebar

From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

Name of workflow run

Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.

Locate job

The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.

Example workflow results

For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
Example action detail

More starter workflows
GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.

You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.

More complex examples
For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.

Next steps
The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:

Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

++
++Introduction
++You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
++
++The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
++
++Creating your first workflow
++Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
++
++In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
++
++Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
++
++YAML
++name: GitHub Actions Demo
++on: [push]
++jobs:
++Explore-GitHub-Actions:
++runs-on: ubuntu-latest
++steps:
++
++run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
++run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
++run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
++name: Check out repository code
++uses: actions/checkout@v3
++run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
++run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
++name: List files in the repository
++run: |
++ls ${{ github.workspace }}
++run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
++Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
++Commit workflow file
++Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
++
++Viewing your workflow results
++On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
++
++Under your repository name, click Actions.
++Actions tab in the main repository navigation
++
++In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
++
++Workflow list in left sidebar
++
++From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
++
++Name of workflow run
++
++Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
++
++Locate job
++
++The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
++
++Example workflow results
++
++For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
++Example action detail
++
++More starter workflows
++GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
++
++You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
++
++More complex examples
++For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
++
++Next steps
++The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
++
++Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
++You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
++GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

++
++Introduction
++You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
++
++The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
++
++Creating your first workflow
++Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
++
++In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
++
++Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
++
++YAML
++name: GitHub Actions Demo
++on: [push]
++jobs:
++Explore-GitHub-Actions:
++runs-on: ubuntu-latest
++steps:
++
++run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
++run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
++run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
++name: Check out repository code
++uses: actions/checkout@v3
++run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
++run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
++name: List files in the repository
++run: |
++ls ${{ github.workspace }}
++run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
++Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
++Commit workflow file
++Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
++
++Viewing your workflow results
++On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
++
++Under your repository name, click Actions.
++Actions tab in the main repository navigation
++
++In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
++
++Workflow list in left sidebar
++
++From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
++
++Name of workflow run
++
++Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
++
++Locate job
++
++The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
++
++Example workflow results
++
++For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
++Example action detail
++
++More starter workflows
++GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
++
++You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
++
++More complex examples
++For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
++
++Next steps
++The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
++
++Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
++You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
++GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

+
+Introduction
+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML
+name: GitHub Actions Demo
+on: [push]
+jobs:
+Explore-GitHub-Actions:
+runs-on: ubuntu-latest
+steps:
+
+run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
+run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
+run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is {{ github.repository }}."
+name: Check out repository code
+uses: actions/checkout@v3
+run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
+run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
+name: List files in the repository
+run: |
+ls ${{ github.workspace }}
+run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
+Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
+Commit workflow file
+Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
+
+Viewing your workflow results
+On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
+
+Under your repository name, click Actions.
+Actions tab in the main repository navigation
+
+In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
+
+Workflow list in left sidebar
+
+From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.
+
+Name of workflow run
+
+Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
+
+Locate job
+
+The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
+
+Example workflow results
+
+For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
+Example action detail
+
+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
+
+Next steps
+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+
+Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
+You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
+GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

+You only need a GitHub repository to create and run a GitHub Actions workflow. In this guide, you'll add a workflow that demonstrates some of the essential features of GitHub Actions.
+
+The following example shows you how GitHub Actions jobs can be automatically triggered, where they run, and how they can interact with the code in your repository.
+
+Creating your first workflow
+Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository on GitHub if this directory does not already exist.
+
+In the .github/workflows directory, create a file named github-actions-demo.yml. For more information, see "Creating new files."
+
+Copy the following YAML contents into the github-actions-demo.yml file:
+
+YAML

+Scroll to the bottom of the page and select Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Then, to create a pull request, click Propose new file.
+Commit workflow file
+Committing the workflow file to a branch in your repository triggers the push event and runs your workflow.
+
+Viewing your workflow results
+On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
+
+Under your repository name, click Actions.
+Actions tab in the main repository navigation
+
+In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.
+
+Workflow list in left sidebar
+
+From the list of workflow runs, click the name of the run you want to see.

+Under Jobs , click the Explore-GitHub-Actions job.
+

+
+The log shows you how each of the steps was processed. Expand any of the steps to view its details.
+
+Example workflow results
+
+For example, you can see the list of files in your repository:
+Example action detail
+
+More starter workflows
+GitHub provides preconfigured starter workflow that you can customize to create your own continuous integration workflow. GitHub analyzes your code and shows you CI starter workflow that might be useful for your repository. For example, if your repository contains Node.js code, you'll see suggestions for Node.js projects. You can use starter workflow as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is.
+
+You can browse the full list of starter workflow in the actions/starter-workflows repository.
+
+More complex examples
+For examples that demonstrate more complex features of GitHub Actions, see "Examples." You can see detailed examples that explain how to test your code on a runner, access the GitHub CLI, and use advanced features such as concurrency and test matrices.
+
+Next steps
+The example workflow you just added runs each time code is pushed to the branch, and shows you how GitHub Actions can work with the contents of your repository. But this is only the beginning of what you can do with GitHub Actions:
+
+Your repository can contain multiple workflows that trigger different jobs based on different events.
+You can use a workflow to install software testing apps and have them automatically test your code on GitHub's runners.
+GitHub Actions can help you automate nearly every aspect of your application development processes. Ready to get started? Here are some helpful resources for taking your next steps with GitHub Actions:

A GitHub action to create a pull request for changes to your repository in the actions workspace.

Changes to a repository in the Actions workspace persist between steps in a workflow.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with other steps that modify or add files to your repository.
The changes will be automatically committed to a new branch and a pull request created.

Create Pull Request action will:

1. Check for repository changes in the Actions workspace. This includes:
   - untracked (new) files
   - tracked (modified) files
   - commits made during the workflow that have not been pushed
2. Commit all changes to a new branch, or update an existing pull request branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch into the base&mdash;the branch checked out in the workflow.

## Documentation

- [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md)
- [Examples](docs/examples.md)
- [Updating to v3](docs/updating.md)

## Usage

```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Make changes to pull request here

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
```

You can also pin to a [specific release](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/releases) version in the format `@v3.x.x`

### Action inputs

All inputs are **optional**. If not set, sensible defaults will be used.

**Note**: If you want pull requests created by this action to trigge-on: worksflows_call:-on:'Run:run-on:-,oon:Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a `repo` scoped [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `path` | Relative path under `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to the repository. | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` |
| `commit-message` | The message to use when committing changes. | `[create-pull-request] automated change` |
| `committer` | The committer name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the GitHub Actions bot user. | `GitHub <noreply@github.com>` |
| `author` | The author name and email address in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`. Defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. | `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>` |
| `signoff` | Add [`Signed-off-by`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) line by the committer at the end of the commit log message. | `false` |

| `push-to-fork` | A fork of the checked-out parent repository to which the pull request branch will be pushed. e.g. `owner/repo-fork`. The pull request will be created to merge the fork's branch into the parent's base. See [push pull request branches to a fork](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details. | |
| `title` | The title of the pull request. | `Changes by create-pull-request action` |

### Action outputs

The pull request number and URL are available as step outputs.
Note that in order to read the step outputs the action step must have an id.

```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
```

### Action behaviour

The default behaviour of the action is to create a pull request that will be continually updated with new changes until it is merged or closed.
Changes are committed and pushed to a fixed-name branch, the name of which can be configured with the `branch` input.
Any subsequent changes will be committed to the *same* branch and reflected in the open pull request.

How the action behaves:

- If there are changes (i.e. a diff exists with the checked-out base branch), the changes will be pushed to a new `branch` and a pull request created.
- If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch), no pull request will be created and the action exits silently.
- If a pull request already exists and there are no further changes (i.e. no diff with the current pull request branch) then the action exits silently.
- If a pull request exists and new changes on the base branch make the pull request unnecessary (i.e. there is no longer a diff between the pull request branch and the base), the pull request is automatically closed. Additionally, if `delete-branch` is set to `true` the `branch` will be deleted.

For further details about how the action works and usage guidelines, see [Concepts, guidelines and advanced usage](docs/concepts-guidelines.md).

#### Alternative strategy - Always create a new pull request branch

For some use cases it may be desirable to always create a new unique branch each time there are changes to be committed.
This strategy is *not recommended* because if not used carefully it could result in multiple pull requests being created unnecessarily. If in doubt, use the [default strategy](#action-behaviour) of creating an updating a fixed-name branch.

To use this strategy, set input `branch-suffix` with one of the following options.

- `random` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with a random alpha-numeric string. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-6qj97jr`, `create-pull-request/patch-5jrjhvd`

- `timestamp` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed by a timestamp. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-1569322532`, `create-pull-request/patch-1569322552`

- `short-commit-hash` - Commits will be made to a branch suffixed with the short SHA1 commit hash. e.g. `create-pull-request/patch-fcdfb59`, `create-pull-request/patch-394710b`

### Controlling commits

As well as relying on the action to handle uncommitted changes, you can additionally make your own commits before the action runs.
Note that the repository must be checked out on a branch with a remote, it won't work for [events which checkout a commit](docs/concepts-guidelines.md#events-which-checkout-a-commit).

```yml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Create commits
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Peter Evans'
          git config user.email 'peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com'
          date +%s > report.txt
          git commit -am "Modify tracked file during workflow"
          date +%s > new-report.txt
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Add untracked file during workflow"
      - name: Uncommitted change
        run: date +%s > report.txt
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
```

### Ignoring files

If there are files or directories you want to ignore you can simply add them to a `.gitignore` file at the root of your repository. The action will respect this file.

### Create a project card

To create a project card for the pull request, pass the `pull-request-number` step output to [create-or-update-project-card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card) action.

```yml
      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3

      - name: Create or Update Project Card
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-project-card@v1
        with:
          project-name: My project
          column-name: My column
          issue-number: ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
```

## Reference Example

The following workflow sets many of the action's inputs for reference purposes.
Check the [defaults](#action-inputs) to avoid setting inputs unnecessarily.

See [examples](docs/examples.md) for more realistic use cases.

```yml
jobs:
  createPullRequest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Make changes to pull request
        run: date +%s > report.txt

      - name: Create Pull Request
        id: cpr
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          commit-message: Update report
          committer: GitHub <noreply@github.com>
          author: ${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>
          signoff: false
          branch: example-patches
          delete-branch: true
          title: '[Example] Update report'
          body: |
            Update report
            - Updated with *today's* date
            - Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1]

            [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request
          labels: |
            report
            automated pr
          assignees: peter-evans
          reviewers: peter-evans
          team-reviewers: |
            owners
            maintainers
          milestone: 1
          draft: false

      - name: Check outputs
        run: |
          echo "Pull Request Number - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-number }}"
          echo "Pull Request URL - ${{ steps.cpr.outputs.pull-request-url }}"
```

An example based on the above reference configuration creates pull requests that look like this:
